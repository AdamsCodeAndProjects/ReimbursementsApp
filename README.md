# ReimbursementsApp
This is an app is a reimbursements app for a small business.  If an employee would requite reimbursements for a certain thing he did at work, such as getting food, he could request a reimbursement which goes to his manager.  The manager has the ability to accept, deny, and comment on the reimbursement request.  Along side that, the manager can see statistics of all employees, and can view all current and all past reimbursements.  This app is a combination of: 

  *Python 
  *PostreSQL 
  *HTML 
  *CSS
  *Javascript
  
  The app is three tiered with automated testing using Pytest and End to End testing, all with 100% passing tests.  The app features a log-in system so the system can differenciate between employee and manager.
